Tech stack
- Laravel (backend routing, controllers)
- Inertia.js (bridge between Laravel and Vue)
- Vue 3 (composition API)
- TypeScript (frontend types)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- Vite (dev server and bundler)
- Composer and npm/yarn (package managers)

Quick links
- Releases (download and run release files): https://github.com/agusMorales/blank-vue-starter-kit/releases
- Laravel docs: https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits
- Inertia docs: https://inertiajs.com
- Tailwind docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs

Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or newer
- Composer 2.x
- Node.js 16.x or newer
- npm or yarn
- A database server (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) if you use migrations

Installation

1) Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/agusMorales/blank-vue-starter-kit.git
cd blank-vue-starter-kit

2) Install backend dependencies
composer install

3) Install frontend dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn

4) Environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
Edit .env for DB and app config.

5) Build assets and run dev
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

6) Migrate database
php artisan migrate

7) Open app
Visit http://localhost:8000 after starting the dev server
php artisan serve

If you downloaded a packaged release from the Releases page, extract the archive and run the included install script or follow the bundled README inside the release. The release file requires execution to set up compiled assets and dependencies.

Project layout
- app/ â€” Laravel app code (models, controllers, policies)
- resources/js/ â€” Vue frontend entry, pages, components
- resources/css/ â€” Tailwind entry and styles
- routes/ â€” Laravel routes (web.php)
- database/ â€” migrations and factories
- vite.config.ts â€” Vite config for dev and build
- tailwind.config.js â€” Tailwind config
- tsconfig.json â€” TypeScript config
- package.json â€” frontend scripts and deps
- composer.json â€” PHP deps

Development workflow
- Use Laravel controllers to return Inertia responses.
- Keep page components in resources/js/Pages.
- Reuse layout components in resources/js/Layouts.
- Use props to pass server data to pages.
- Keep API logic in controllers or API routes and use Inertia only for page responses.
- Use Vite for dev HMR and fast builds in production.

Common commands
- Start Laravel dev server
php artisan serve

- Vite dev server
npm run dev
yarn dev

- Build production assets
npm run build
yarn build

- Run tests (PHP)
php artisan test

- Run backend migrations
php artisan migrate

- Install composer deps
composer install

Customize
- Add auth: choose Laravel Breeze, Fortify, or a custom solution. This starter does not include auth to keep the code simple.
- Tailwind: adjust tailwind.config.js to add color palettes, plugins, and utilities.
- TypeScript: update tsconfig.json to enforce stricter rules or relaxed types.
- Components: add shared UI components to resources/js/Components.
- API: add API routes in routes/api.php and create controllers in app/Http/Controllers/API.

Deployment
- Build assets
npm run build

- Configure your web server to point to the Laravel public directory.

- Environment
Set APP_ENV=production and APP_DEBUG=false in .env. Set database and cache credentials.

- Queue and scheduler
Use a process manager (supervisord, systemd) to run queue workers and cron for schedule:run.

- Common hosts
You can deploy to Forge, Vapor, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or any host that supports PHP and a Node build step.

Testing
- Unit tests (PHP): php artisan test
- Browser / E2E: connect Playwright or Cypress to the dev server and test UI flows.
- Linting
  - ESLint or custom linter for TypeScript
  - phpstan or pest for PHP static analysis

Troubleshooting
- Asset mismatch after deploy
  - Run npm run build on the server or CI and clear caches.
  - php artisan view:clear
  - php artisan config:clear
  - php artisan route:clear
  - php artisan cache:clear

- Inertia page not updating
  - Confirm Vite HMR runs in dev.
  - Ensure Inertia visits use server-side Inertia responses.

- Type errors
  - Check tsconfig paths and imports.
  - Use type guards where server data can vary.
